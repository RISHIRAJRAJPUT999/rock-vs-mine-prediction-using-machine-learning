# Rock or Mine Prediction - Machine Learning Model

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **Rock vs. Mine Prediction** system built using **Machine Learning** in Google Colab. The model classifies objects as either **rock** or **mine** using **Logistic Regression**.

## 🚀 Features
- Preprocessing of numerical dataset
- Training and testing using **Logistic Regression**
- Evaluation using **accuracy score**
- Lightweight and easy-to-deploy model

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset consists of sensor readings that help determine whether an object is a **rock** or a **mine**. It can be obtained from publicly available sources such as Kaggle or UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## 📜 Libraries Used
The model is implemented using the following libraries:
- **numpy**: Numerical computations
- **pandas**: Data handling and manipulation
- **train_test_split**: Splitting dataset into training and testing sets
- **LogisticRegression**: Classification model
- **accuracy_score**: Evaluating model performance

## 📊 Model Performance
The model is evaluated using standard classification metrics such as:
- Accuracy:0.7619047619047619 %
